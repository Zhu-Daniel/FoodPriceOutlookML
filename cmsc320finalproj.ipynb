    "# Introduction\n",
    "Food prices are an integral part of the lives of every individual. By looking at food prices, one can gauge the relative economic situation of a nation and see how the average cost of living changes over time. Specifically, due to esource shortages caused by the coronavirus we were curious to see if we could find trends in prices caused by Covid 19 or other significant events.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be examining the changes in food prices over time from 1974 to 2020, examining the average change in price paid for different types of food, from meats such as pork and beef to sweets. Average change in price paid by urban consumers is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), measured in percentage relative to a base year (100%) (<a href=\"www.bls.gov/cpi/\">bls.gov</a>). \"It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them.\" (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20(CPI)%20is%20a%20measure%20that%20examines,of%20goods%20and%20averaging%20them.\">investopedia.com</a>) (eg. fruit CPI might include changes in cost of apples, bannanas, fresh and processed fruit, etc). CPI changes are associated with cost of living.<br> <br>\n",
    "The data comes from <a href=\"www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook.aspx.\">ers.usda.gov</a> The CPI for food measures the changes in retail price of food items over time. <br> <br>\n",
    "The data table contains the percent change in CPI annually for various food items (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reference_base_period.asp\">investopedia.com</a>). <br>\n",
    "##### CPI Annual Percent Change = (CPI(year) - CPI(previous year))/CPI(previous year) <br>\n",
    "This is simply the change in consumer price of goods by year."
