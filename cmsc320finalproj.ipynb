Average change in price paid by urban consumers is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), measured in percentage relative to a base year (100%) (<a href=\"www.bls.gov/cpi/\">bls.gov</a>). \"It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them.\" (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20(CPI)%20is%20a%20measure%20that%20examines,of%20goods%20and%20averaging%20them.\">investopedia.com</a>) (eg. fruit CPI might include changes in cost of apples, bannanas, fresh and processed fruit, etc). CPI changes are associated with cost of living.<br> <br>\n",
